## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Fast node on an Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use-case the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can
fast-sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```
$ geth [|--classic|--social|--ethersocial|--mix|--music|--testnet|--rinkeby|--kotti|--goerli|--mordor] console
```

This command will:
 * Start `geth` in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
   causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
   of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
 * Start up `geth`'s built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/JavaScript-Console),
   (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can invoke all official [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)
   as well as `geth`'s own [management APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs).
   This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running
   `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Ethereum test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```shell
$ geth --testnet console
```

The `console` subcommand has the exact same meaning as above and they are equally
useful on the testnet too. Please see above for their explanations if you've skipped here.

Specifying the `--testnet` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:

 * Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`
   will nest itself one level deeper into a `testnet` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/testnet` on
   Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node
   requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a
   production node endpoint by default. E.g.
   `geth attach <datadir>/testnet/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by
   this.
 * Instead of connecting the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the test
   network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis states.

*Note: Although there are some internal protective measures to prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should make sure to always
use separate accounts for play-money and real-money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Full node on the Rinkeby test network

The above test network is a cross-client one based on the ethash proof-of-work consensus
algorithm. As such, it has certain extra overhead and is more susceptible to reorganization
attacks due to the network's low difficulty/security. Go Ethereum also supports connecting
to a proof-of-authority based test network called [*Rinkeby*](https://www.rinkeby.io)
(operated by members of the community). This network is lighter, more secure, but is only
supported by go-ethereum.

```shell
$ geth --rinkeby console
```

This command will start geth in a full archive mode, causing it to download, process, and store the entirety
of available chain data.

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```shell
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```shell
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

*Note: This works only with `geth` v1.6.0 and above.*
